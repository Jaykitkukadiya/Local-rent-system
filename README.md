# Local-rent-system

•	The aim was to implement a Local rent system to create a win-win situation for tourists, landlords, and the platform. 
•	This project provides a web platform through which tourists can find a temporary room service nearby their area, landlords can use their free rooms as a source of income by providing guest service to the tourists, and the platform can get a commission on each booking of tourists.
•	Price is certainly lower in comparison with hotel rooms, and tourists can get a chance to gain a home environment.
•	This initiative is comparable to Airbnb's concept.
